# Contributing to Mirai
We welcome contributions and want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. A background in compilers and static analysis will be very useful for contributing to the main
code base, but there are ample opportunities for other contributions as well. Test cases and motivating examples
are particularly welcome.

## Our Development Process
Every pull request should have a description that motivates it and
should have tests that cover all of the source lines touched and added by the request. No pull request will be merged
unless all tests are passing.

A TODO comment should include the number of an issue that describes the outstanding work in greater detail.

All APIs should be [documented](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html) in the code and
all public methods and functions should have explicit assertion statements to document and enforce any preconditions 
that they depend on.

A pull request that is a work in progress that has been published to get help and feedback from the community should
be tagged with WIP.

The person approving a pull request will also merge it into main.
