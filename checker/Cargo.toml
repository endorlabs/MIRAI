# Dependencies for tests which aren't already included by the checker.
# Note if you add one here it also needs to be added to the command line
# of the cargo command using it, e.g.
# `--extern contracts=$PROJECT_DIR$/target/debug/deps/libcontracts-c8ea818f33e46907.dylib`
# or similar, and to integration_tests.rs (search for extern_deps there).
# We set the dep to a specific revision so we don't get paths as above not longer working after update of the repo
# and the Cargo.lock.
